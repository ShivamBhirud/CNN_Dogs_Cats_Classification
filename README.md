# CNN_Dogs_Cats_Classification
CNN model using Keras to classify between Dogs and Cats images

Dataset (training and testing images data) size has been reduced while uploading this project here, as it is just for demo purpose and to show the structure of the folders in the parent dataset folder. Structure of the folders in the dataset folder matters because Keras requires it to be arranged in that way.
